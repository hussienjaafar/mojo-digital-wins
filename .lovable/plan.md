# UX/UI Audit: Ad Copy Studio

## Executive Summary

After a deep review of all 5 wizard steps, the page wrapper, and the live UI, I've identified **19 issues** across navigation, information architecture, clarity, and visual design. The core problems center around: (1) users not knowing what's expected of them at each step, (2) important information buried or missing, (3) the org selector being confusing, and (4) the export step being hard to use for the actual workflow of pasting into Meta Ads Manager.

---

## Issue 1: HIGH -- No Padding Inside Step Content Area

The step content renders inside a `rounded-lg border` container but the individual steps (`VideoUploadStep`, etc.) don't have consistent inner padding. `VideoUploadStep` has `flex flex-col gap-6` with no padding, causing content to touch the card edges. Some steps have internal padding on sub-elements but not on the wrapper, creating inconsistent spacing.

**Fix:** Add `p-6` to the motion.div wrapper in `AdCopyWizard.tsx` (line 710) or ensure each step component has consistent `p-6` padding.

---

## Issue 2: HIGH -- Organization Picker Has No Context

The org selector in the header shows a dropdown but provides no label. A user seeing "Select organization" doesn't understand *why* they need to pick one or what it affects. There's also no indication of which org is currently selected in the header bar (the page-level header in `AdminAdCopyStudio.tsx` shows nothing about the org).

**Fix:** Add a label like "Creating ads for:" before the org picker. Show the selected org name prominently in the page header.

---

## Issue 3: HIGH -- Switching Orgs Mid-Session Silently Breaks State

When a user switches organizations mid-wizard, the session is tied to the original org. Videos, transcripts, and ActBlue forms belong to the original org. There's no warning, no session reset, and no confirmation dialog. The user could generate copy using Org A's transcript but Org B's ActBlue forms.

**Fix:** When org changes, show a confirmation dialog: "Switching organizations will reset your current session. Continue?" Then call `resetSession()` if confirmed.

---

## Issue 4: HIGH -- Step 1 Upload: Google Drive Section Appears First

The Google Drive import is positioned *above* the direct file upload drop zone. For most users, drag-and-drop is the primary action. Google Drive import is a secondary/advanced option. This inverted hierarchy makes the primary action less discoverable.

**Fix:** Swap the order -- put the drag-and-drop zone first (primary action), then the "or" divider, then Google Drive import below.

---

## Issue 5: HIGH -- Step 2 Review: No Loading State When Analysis Isn't Ready

If the user advances to Step 2 before transcription completes (which is possible since `canProceed` only requires one "ready" video), they see "No analysis available for this video" with a generic icon. There's no indication that the analysis is still processing, no spinner, no ETA.

**Fix:** Check the video status. If it's `transcribing` or `analyzing`, show a loading spinner with "Analysis in progress..." instead of the empty state. Only show "No analysis available" for videos in `error` or truly missing states.

---

## Issue 6: MEDIUM -- Step 2 Review: "Reviewed X/Y videos" Tracker Is Misleading

The review counter auto-increments when you switch tabs, not when you actually review content. Simply clicking through tabs marks videos as "reviewed" even if the user spent 0 seconds on them. This gives false confidence.

**Fix:** Either remove the counter (it doesn't gate progression anyway -- there's no requirement to review all videos), or make it meaningful by requiring the user to click a "Mark as reviewed" button on each video.

---

## Issue 7: MEDIUM -- Step 2 Review: Analysis Cards Missing Key Data

The analysis panel shows Primary Issue, Tone, Targets Attacked, Pain Points, and Key Phrases, but omits several fields from `TranscriptAnalysis`:
- `targets_supported` (who the candidate supports)
- `political_stances`
- `values_appealed`
- `urgency_drivers`
- `urgency_level`
- `sentiment_score`
- `cta_text`
- `topic_primary` / `topic_tags`

These are all generated by the AI but hidden from the user. The user can't validate or correct them, and they directly influence the ad copy output.

**Fix:** Add cards for the missing fields, especially `targets_supported`, `values_appealed`, `urgency_drivers`, and `sentiment_score` (as a visual gauge). Group related fields logically.

---

## Issue 8: MEDIUM -- Step 3 Configure: No Refcode Auto-Generation on Mount

The refcode field starts empty. The "Regenerate" button exists but doesn't auto-fire. Users must either type a refcode manually or know to click "Regenerate." This creates an unnecessary friction point since most users want an auto-generated refcode.

**Fix:** Auto-generate a refcode on mount if the field is empty. The `refcode_auto_generated` flag already exists in the config.

---

## Issue 9: MEDIUM -- Step 3 Configure: No Preset Audience Segment Templates

Users must manually create every audience segment from scratch. For political fundraising, common segments are predictable (e.g., "Progressive Base," "Swing Voters," "High-Dollar Donors," "Grassroots"). Requiring manual entry every time is tedious and error-prone.

**Fix:** Add a "Quick Add" section with pre-built segment templates that users can add with one click, then customize. Show them as chips/buttons above the segment list.

---

## Issue 10: MEDIUM -- Step 3 Configure: ActBlue Form Dropdown Empty State Is Confusing

If no ActBlue forms are found for the selected org, the dropdown simply has no options. There's no explanation of why it's empty or what to do. The user might not even realize the dropdown is supposed to have options.

**Fix:** Show an inline message when `actblueForms.length === 0`: "No ActBlue forms found for this organization. Forms appear after transaction data is imported."

---

## Issue 11: MEDIUM -- Step 4 Generate: "Total outputs" Math Is Wrong

The summary shows `segmentCount * 5 * 3` outputs. But the actual generation produces 5 *variations* per segment (each variation is a primary_text + headline + description tuple). So 2 segments = 10 variations, not 30 "copy variations." This inflated number sets incorrect expectations.

**Fix:** Show "5 variations per segment" and "10 total variations" (for 2 segments), not "30 copy variations."

---

## Issue 12: MEDIUM -- Step 4 Generate: No Estimated Time

Generation can take 20-60+ seconds per segment. There's a progress bar but no time estimate. Users don't know if they should wait 10 seconds or 5 minutes.

**Fix:** Add an estimated time based on segment count: "Estimated time: ~30 seconds per audience segment."

---

## Issue 13: MEDIUM -- Step 5 Export: Copy Variations Lack Framework Labels

Each variation was generated using a specific framework (PAS, BAB, AIDA, etc.) but this metadata isn't shown. Users can't understand *why* each variation sounds different or make informed choices about which to use.

**Fix:** Show the framework name as a small badge on each variation card (e.g., "PAS" or "AIDA"). This helps users learn which frameworks resonate with their audience.

---

## Issue 14: MEDIUM -- Step 5 Export: No Side-by-Side View for Meta Ads Manager

Users need to copy primary_text + headline + description as a *set* (one variation). But the export step separates them into three independent lists. To assemble a complete ad, users must manually match variation #1 across all three sections. This is the most confusing part of the export flow.

**Fix:** Add a "Variation View" toggle that shows each variation as a complete card (primary_text + headline + description together), in addition to the current "Element View." The variation view should be the default.

---

## Issue 15: LOW -- Step Indicator Is Not Responsive

On narrow screens, the 5-step indicator with icons + labels + connector lines wraps awkwardly. Labels overlap or get truncated.

**Fix:** On mobile, collapse to numbered circles only (no labels) or use a compact horizontal scrollable strip.

---

## Issue 16: LOW -- No Confirmation Before Reset

The "Reset" button in the header uses `window.confirm()` which is a jarring browser-native dialog that doesn't match the dark theme. It's also easy to accidentally click.

**Fix:** Replace with a styled confirmation dialog (using the existing Radix AlertDialog component).

---

## Issue 17: LOW -- Step 1: "Copy diagnostics" Button Is User-Facing Debug Info

After extraction, videos in "ready" state show "Stream copy" or "Re-encoded" badges and a "Copy diagnostics" button. This is developer/debug information that confuses end users.

**Fix:** Remove the extraction mode badge and diagnostics button from the user-facing UI. Keep them in console logs for debugging.

---

## Issue 18: LOW -- Step 5 Export: Tracking URL May Be Empty

If generation failed partially or the tracking URL wasn't generated, the Tracking URL section shows an empty `<code>` block. No indication that something is missing.

**Fix:** Show a fallback message: "No tracking URL generated" when `trackingUrl` is empty.

---

## Issue 19: LOW -- No "Back to Admin" in Wizard Steps

The "Back to Admin" button is in the page header, but during deep wizard steps (3, 4, 5), the header is scrolled out of view. Users feel trapped in the wizard with no way to exit.

**Fix:** Add a persistent exit affordance -- either a fixed header or a small "X" / "Exit" button visible at all times.
